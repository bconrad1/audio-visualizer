## Info

This was a more of a side project just to play around with Canvas and React. The project makes use of the HTML5 Audio element. 

# ToDo

* Make header bar responsive for mobile.
* Potentially hook up Redux to stop having to pass props down to Children. 
* Have canvas clear and re-render on resize so particles spread out when original canvas is smaller than resize.
